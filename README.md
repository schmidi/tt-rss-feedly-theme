tt-rss-feedly-theme
===================

Feedly theme for [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org) 18.12+.

If you are using an older version of TT-RSS, have a look at the branches.

For the best experience, use a current browser. IE9 and older versions are not supported.

This theme is tested in Chrome on a regular basis and should work fine in IE10 and recent versions of Safari, Firefox (28+) and Opera (15+) as well.
